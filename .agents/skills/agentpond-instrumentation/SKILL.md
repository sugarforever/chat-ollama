description: Add OpenInference tracing to trusted Firebase, Supabase, Vercel, or Files SDK-backed applications and export spans directly to AgentPond storage. Use when instrumenting an untraced AI server, adding a missing OpenInference integration, or adapting existing OpenTelemetry setup for direct object storage.

# AgentPond Instrumentation

Instrument trusted server-side AI applications without changing business behavior. Analyze the target service first, reuse existing tracing infrastructure, and keep storage credentials and trace export strictly server-side.

Read the lifecycle and OpenInference references for every task, plus only the
provider reference relevant to the detected deployment:

- Application-owned shutdown and request-lifetime flushing: [references/lifecycle.md](references/lifecycle.md)
- Firebase exporter and Storage Rules: [references/firebase.md](references/firebase.md)
- Supabase exporter, Storage bucket, RLS, and Edge lifecycle: [references/supabase.md](references/supabase.md)
- Vercel exporter, Blob setup, targets, and lifecycle: [references/vercel.md](references/vercel.md)
- Files SDK local verification and production handoff: [references/files-sdk.md](references/files-sdk.md)
- OpenInference routing, custom spans, sessions, and verification: [references/openinference.md](references/openinference.md)

## Core principles

- Inspect before editing. Confirm the service, runtime, package manager, AI SDK, framework, provider, and existing telemetry.
- Instrument only trusted server code. Supabase Edge Functions are supported through their built-in secret variables; other Edge and middleware runtimes are not. Never put AgentPond storage exporters in browser, client, or static bundles.
- Prefer framework or provider auto-instrumentation. Add manual spans only for application logic, chains, tools, or gaps.
- Reuse the existing storage SDK and global OpenTelemetry provider. Do not register a competing provider.
- Initialize tracing before importing or constructing instrumented AI clients.
- Export directly to the selected object store. Do not add an ingestion HTTP route.
- Keep tracing additive and follow the repository's conventions.
- Never add credentials to source code or ask the user to paste secrets into chat.

## Phase 0: preflight

1. Detect Firebase, Supabase, or Vercel project markers. If none exists, use the Files SDK workflow. If multiple exist, ask which platform owns the deployed service; do not persist that choice.
2. Confirm which trusted Node.js service or Supabase Edge Function is in scope. Files SDK direct export requires trusted Node.js. In a monorepo, do not assume every server package should be instrumented.
3. Identify the build, typecheck, start, emulator or deployment, real-request,
   and application lifecycle commands needed for verification.
4. Stop if the target is only client, middleware, unsupported Edge, or static code and ask whether the user wants to add a trusted server runtime.
5. Read the matching platform or Files SDK reference before proposing changes.

## Phase 1: read-only analysis

Do not write files, install packages, link projects, or provision storage during this phase.

1. Inspect platform configuration, AgentPond environments, package manifests, lockfiles, server entrypoints, and existing storage connections.
2. Scan imports to identify AI providers, agent frameworks, existing OpenInference or OpenTelemetry setup, provider SDK initialization, and request, conversation, and tool boundaries.
3. Review the selected storage path's privacy and credential requirements from its reference.
4. Prefer a framework-native OpenInference integration when it captures model and tool spans. Add a provider instrumentor only for a documented gap.
5. Return a concise proposal containing the target service, runtime, package manager, AI SDKs, packages, storage resources, existing initialization to reuse, files, and verification commands.

Stop after presenting the proposal and ask for explicit confirmation before installing packages, editing files, linking a Vercel project, provisioning Blob, or changing Firebase Storage Rules.

## Phase 2: implementation

1. Read current official integration documentation for the detected framework or AI client.
2. Install the platform package (`@agentpond/firebase`, `@agentpond/supabase`, or `@agentpond/vercel`) or the Files SDK packages from its reference, required OpenTelemetry packages, and the matching `@arizeai/openinference-*` package. Use exact versions verified against the target lockfile. In generated scripts or workflow commands, invoke `npx agentpond@<verified-version>` instead of an unqualified package download.
3. Create or update one centralized server instrumentation module.
4. Reuse existing storage and OpenTelemetry initialization, following the matching reference.
5. Create the direct span exporter and attach it to the existing provider. When none exists, prefer NodeSDK's batched `traceExporter` configuration or an explicit `BatchSpanProcessor` supported by the installed version.
6. Register OpenInference instrumentation before AI clients are created.
7. Add manual CHAIN and TOOL spans only where auto-instrumentation leaves important behavior invisible.
8. Preserve one `session.id` across all turns in the same conversation.
9. Apply the storage-specific privacy and target requirements, then follow the
   application-owned lifecycle pattern in
   [references/lifecycle.md](references/lifecycle.md).

## Verification

Treat the work as complete only when the project builds or typechecks, the trusted runtime loads without duplicate-provider errors, one real AI request exports OpenInference spans, the real lifecycle boundary finishes exporting them, and the trace appears after the sync workflow in the matching reference.

Inspect the trace and confirm applicable model, CHAIN, TOOL, input/output, parent-child, and session attributes. For short-lived processes, force-flush before exit. Do not shut down a reusable module-level provider after every request.

Inspect the raw stored object and ensure it does not expose credentials or unnecessary personal data.

## Attribution

This workflow is adapted from Arize AI's MIT-licensed [arize-instrumentation skill](https://github.com/Arize-ai/arize-skills/tree/main/skills/arize-instrumentation). It replaces Arize-specific export and verification with AgentPond direct export to Firebase Storage, Supabase Storage, Vercel Blob, or Files SDK while retaining the analyze-then-implement workflow.
