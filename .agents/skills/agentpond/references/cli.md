# AgentPond data-access CLI

Run AgentPond through `npx` unless it is installed globally.

## Check setup support

Before setup automation changes a project, run:

```bash
npx agentpond init check --json
```

`supported` is the verdict; `project`, `setup`, and `requirements` describe the
detected setup. When unsupported, `reason` explains why and what to do next.

## Select data

Use the provider-specific reference for Firebase, Supabase, or Vercel. Environment
selection uses the same commands for every provider:

```bash
npx agentpond env current
npx agentpond env use <environment>
npx agentpond --env staging sync
```

`env use` persists through the detected provider. `--env` overrides that
selection for one command. The provider-specific meaning and persistence are
documented in the Firebase, Supabase, and Vercel references. Sync before querying when
recent data matters.

When multiple provider markers are present, use `--platform firebase`,
`--platform supabase`, or `--platform vercel` on each AgentPond command. This
override is stateless and does not create provider-choice state:

```bash
npx agentpond env current --platform supabase
npx agentpond sync --platform supabase
```

For manually configured Files SDK deployments, `env list`, `env init`, and
`env get` manage Files SDK-backed AgentPond environment files. Those manual
operations and the local testing server are unavailable when AgentPond detects
Firebase, Supabase, or Vercel.

Detected Firebase, Supabase, and Vercel projects use the same shared
Files SDK object-store layer internally, but their provider contexts choose the
adapter, credentials, bucket, project identity, and prefix. Do not replace a
detected provider context with a manual Files SDK environment.

Select and sync an existing Files SDK environment:

```bash
npx agentpond env use production
npx agentpond sync
```

The environment file stores `FILES_SDK_PROVIDER` plus the selected adapter's
typed configuration: `AGENTPOND_FILES_BUCKET`,
`AGENTPOND_FILES_CONTAINER`, `AGENTPOND_FILES_NAMESPACE`,
`AGENTPOND_FILES_STORE_NAME`, `FILES_SDK_ENDPOINT`, `FILES_SDK_REGION`, or
`FILES_SDK_ROOT`. `env init` exposes the matching `--bucket`, `--container`,
`--endpoint`, `--namespace`, `--region`, `--root`, and `--store-name` flags. It
does not store credentials. Run AgentPond with the selected provider's
credential variables available in the process environment. Keep
`AGENTPOND_PROJECT_ID` and `AGENTPOND_PREFIX` identical to the application
runtime; `default-project` and an empty prefix are the defaults. Memory,
Bun-only, unknown, malformed, and unsupported adapter configurations are
rejected. The CLI also rejects adapters whose peer SDKs it cannot resolve.

Azure Blob uses Files SDK's `AZURE_STORAGE_*` variables. Netlify runtimes detect
their site and token automatically; external runtimes use `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` and
`NETLIFY_API_TOKEN`. Oracle Cloud uses `OCI_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`OCI_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` HMAC Customer Secret Keys.

`env init` refuses to replace an existing environment file; edit that file
deliberately or initialize a different name.

`npx agentpond init` installs both AgentPond skills and prints either a
platform-specific or Files SDK coding-agent prompt. It does not initialize an
environment itself. Cancelling skill installation stops setup without printing
a success message or prompt.

## Query commands

```bash
npx agentpond sync
npx agentpond sync --json

npx agentpond traces list --limit 25
npx agentpond traces get <trace-id>
npx agentpond observations list --traceId <trace-id>

npx agentpond sessions list
npx agentpond sessions get <session-id>

npx agentpond scores list --traceId <trace-id>
npx agentpond scores list --observationId <observation-id>

npx agentpond sql "select * from traces limit 10"
npx agentpond sql "select * from scores where trace_id = '<trace-id>'" --json
```

Use JSON output when another tool needs to consume the result. Use focused commands for individual resources and SQL for aggregation, joins, time filtering, raw events, and cost analysis.
